# Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices

This project is an exploration of time series analysis and forecasting techniques applied to financial data. Using a sample dataset of stock prices, this repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of analyzing time-dependent data and building various forecasting models to predict future trends.

The core of this project is the practical implementation of several fundamental time series models, from simple moving averages to more complex seasonal models.

## Project Highlights

* **Foundational Analysis:** Leveraged foundational knowledge in probability, statistics, and linear regression to understand the underlying principles of time series data.
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Utilized Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to load, clean, and visualize the stock price dataset. This included plotting trends, seasonality, and other statistical properties.
* **Forecasting and Trend Prediction:** Applied a suite of classical forecasting methods to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## Models Implemented

This project implements and evaluates the following time series forecasting models:

1.  **MA (Moving Average):** A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
2.  **ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average):** A combination of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models, used for stationary time series.
3.  **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** An extension of ARMA that can be applied to non-stationary data by incorporating a degree of differencing (I).
4.  **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):** An advanced version of ARIMA that is specifically designed to handle time series data with a seasonal component.
